Python Essentials - Professor Lieberman - August 2023
M03 Programming Assignment
INTRODUCTION: In this assignment, you will demonstrate how to write simple programs that get input from the user, produce output, perform simple calculations, make decisions and implement repetition (loops).

HOW TO SUBMIT YOUR ASSIGNMENT

At the top of each of your programs, you should have at least four lines of documentation:

Program name (the Python file name(s)), Author (your name), Date last updated, and Purpose (a brief description of what the program accomplishes). Here is an example:

################################
# Program name: jbtictactoe.py

#  Author: John Doe
#  Course: Python Essentials
#  Date: 5/1/2021
#  Assignment: Module 3 - Distance Traveled
#  Purpose: Calculate Distance Traveled.....
########################################

ASSIGNMENT 1: Triangles

A triangle has three sides where the sum of the length of any (every) two of the sides must exceed the other side.

In a right triangle, the square of the length of the longest side is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

In an isosceles triangle the length of any two of the sides must be equal.

In an equilateral triangle the length of all three sides must be equal.

Write a program that prompts the user to enter the lengths of three sides of a triangle. The program will output a message indicating:


whether or not the lengths form a triangle and, if so, 
whether or not the triangle is
 a right triangle,
an isosceles triangle, and/or 
an equilateral triangle.
Input Validation: Do not accept a number <= 0 for any side.

ASSIGNMENT 2:  Distance Traveled

The distance a vehicle travels can be calculated as follows:

distance = speed * time

For example, if a train travels 40 miles per hour for 3 hours, the distance traveled is 120 miles.

Write a program that asks the user for the speed of a vehicle (in miles per hour) and how many hours it has traveled. The program should then use a loop to display the distance the vehicle has traveled for each hour of that time period. Here is an example of the output:

What is the speed of the vehicle in mph? 40
How many hours has it traveled? 3
Hour  Distance Traveled
--------------------------------
 1           40
 2           80
 3          120
Input Validation: Do not accept a negative number for speed and do not accept any value less than 1 for time traveled.



To submit your assignments:

Submit your source code files (*.py) appropriately named for each assignment.
Submit screen shots demonstrating your program works correctly. Any program that requires user input should be run a minimum of three times with varying test values. Screenshots may be embedded in a document for submission or submitted individually.
