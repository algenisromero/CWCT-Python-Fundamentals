# COURSE OUTLINE

### COURSE TITLE: Introduction to Python for Cyber Security
### COURSE NUMBER: CWCT 140
### CONTACT HOURS: Lecture: 3 Lab:  3 
<br />

**CATALOG DESCRIPTION:**   
Provides an understanding of fundamental concepts of the Python programming language. The emphasis will be on creating industry-standard programs using current programming design software.  Students will learn basic programming concepts such as sequence, iteration, and decision structures; variables and constants; functions; and the basic concepts of object-oriented programming. These skills will be practiced in a hands-on environment.  Students will practice skills such as team building, work ethic, communication, documentation, and adaptability.
